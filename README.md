# serverless-contactus-nodejs-AzureFunction
Simple serverless application that sends an email using Azure Functions and SendGrid.

This demo application contains a static HTML contact page and a JavaScript-based function that uses the Azure Functions Runtime 2.0. The HTML page can be served from Azure Storage. When users fill out and submit the form, it invokes the function and sends the form details via email using SendGrid.
